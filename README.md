# LASR Cards Repository

## About LASR

LASR (Learn, Apply, Study, Review) is a comprehensive review methodology designed to help developers improve their code quality through systematic reflection and learning. The method provides structured guidance for identifying and addressing common coding issues, architectural problems, and technical debt.

For more information about the LASR methodology, visit [lasr-reviews.org](https://lasr-reviews.org).

## Repository Purpose

This repository maintains the official LASR review cards in multiple languages. These cards serve as quick reference guides during code reviews, helping developers:

- Identify common code smells and anti-patterns
- Apply best practices consistently
- Learn from systematic review patterns
- Build better software through continuous improvement

## Structure

The repository is organized by language codes:

```
├── DE/                 # German cards
│   └── LASR-Karten-MAIN/
├── EN/                 # English cards (planned)
├── FR/                 # French cards (planned)
└── ...                 # Additional languages
```

Each card is stored as a JSON file containing:
- Problem identification criteria
- Solution approaches
- Best practice recommendations
- Review checklist items

## Card Categories

The cards are numbered and categorized to address different aspects of software development:

1. **Solution Complexity** - Managing and reducing unnecessary complexity
2. **Technical Knowledge** - Addressing knowledge gaps and technical debt
3. **Code Quality** - Improving readability, maintainability, and performance
4. **Architecture** - Structural improvements and design patterns
5. **Testing & Validation** - Ensuring robust and reliable code

## Booster Packs

In addition to the main card deck, specialized booster packs are planned for:
- Domain-specific patterns
- Framework-specific best practices
- Advanced architectural patterns
- Team collaboration improvements

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to:
- Translate cards into new languages
- Improve existing card content
- Add new cards based on community feedback
- Develop specialized booster packs

Please ensure all contributions maintain the established JSON structure and follow the LASR methodology principles.

## Usage

These cards are designed to be used during:
- Code reviews
- Pair programming sessions
- Technical retrospectives
- Personal learning and improvement
- Team training and onboarding
