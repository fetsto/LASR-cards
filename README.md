# LASR Cards Repository

A curated repository for managing the **LASR cards**—supporting tools for the **Lightweight Approach for Software Reviews (LASR)** method.

## What is LASR?

LASR (Lightweight Approach for Software Reviews) is a streamlined, community-driven method for performing fast and effective software and architecture reviews. It empowers small teams (often 3–4 people) to identify the most critical quality attributes and risks efficiently—typically within just a few hours. The method is accessible, flexible, and free to use, even in commercial contexts :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

### Key Features of LASR:
- **Lean and fast**: Initial results are available after a half-day workshop :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
- **Accessible**: No extensive training or documentation required; anyone curious can get started :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
- **Engaging method**: Uses a gamified, card-based moderation style to facilitate discussion and decision-making :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
- **Supportive toolset**: Includes downloadable templates, checklists, cheat sheets, and the all-important LASR cards (available as “Print & Play”) :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

## Usage & Workshop Workflow

1. **Select quality attributes** for the review using “Top-5 Challenger” cards.
2. **Define target levels** (0–100 scale), creating the green baseline in the LASR spider chart :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.
3. **Identify risks** using risk cards and plot your system’s current standing against targets.
4. **Explore deeper analysis**, optionally using additional booster or extension cards to refine focus areas :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.
5. Use **cheat sheet** and process diagrams for guidance during the workshop :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.
